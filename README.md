Flappy Bird is a cool little game with easy to understand mechanics,
and I thought it would be the perfect fit to create an HTML5 (beginner) game.

Running a Phaser game directly in a browser doesn't work,
because Javascript is not allowed to load files from your system
local files. To resolve this, you have to use a web server
to play the game.

I recommend using <a href="https://gitpod.io/"> Gitpod </a>!

There are several ways to configure a local web server
on a computer and Iâ€™ll cover three quickly below.

1- Use brackets. Open the directory containing the game in the <a href="http://brackets.io/"> bracket editor </a>
and click on the small screw icon in the upper right corner of the window. This will open directly
your browser with a live view of a web server.

2- Use applications. You can download <a href="http://www.wampserver.com/en/"> WAMP </a> (Windows) or <a href = "https://www.mamp.info/en/" > MAMP </a>
(Mac). Both have a clean user interface, with simple configuration guides available.

3- Use the <a href="https://gitpod.io/"> Gitpod </a>!
They have a clean user interface, with simple configuration guides available.
(This is probably the easiest solution.)
